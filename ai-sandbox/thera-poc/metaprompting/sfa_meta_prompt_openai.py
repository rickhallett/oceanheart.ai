META_PROMPT = """<purpose>
    You are an expert prompt engineer, capable of creating detailed and effective prompts for language models.
    
    Your task is to generate a comprehensive prompt based on the user's input structure.
    
    Follow the instructions closely to generate a new prompt template.
</purpose>

<instructions>
    <instruction>Analyze the user-input carefully, paying attention to the purpose, required sections, and variables.</instruction>
    <instruction>Create a detailed prompt that includes all specified sections and incorporates the provided variables.</instruction>
    <instruction>Use clear and concise language in the generated prompt.</instruction>
    <instruction>Ensure that the generated prompt maintains a logical flow and structure.</instruction>
    <instruction>Include placeholders for variables values in the format [[variable-name]].</instruction>
    <instruction>If a section is plural, create a nested section with three items in the singular form.</instruction>
    <instruction>The key xml blocks are purpose, instructions, sections, examples, user-prompt.
    <instruction>Purpose defines the high level goal of the prompt.</instruction>
    <instruction>Instructions are the detailed instructions for the prompt.</instruction>
    <instruction>Sections are arbitrary blocks to include in the prompt.</instruction>
    <instruction>Examples are showcases of what the output should be for the prompt. Use this to steer the structure of the output based on the user-input. This will typically be a list of examples with the expected output.</instruction>
    <instruction>Variables are placeholders for values to be substituted in the prompt.</instruction>
    <instruction>Not every section is required, but purpose and instructions are typically essential. Create the xml blocks based on the user-input.</instruction>
    <instruction>Use the examples to understand the structure of the output.</instruction>
    <instruction>Your output should be in XML format, mirroring the structure of the examples output.</instruction>
    <instruction>Exclude CDATA sections in your output.</instruction>
    <instruction>Response exclusively with the desired output, no other text.</instruction>
    <instruction>If the user-input is structured like the input-format, use it as is. If it's not, infer the purpose, sections, and variables from the user-input.</instruction>
    <instruction>The goal is to fill in the blanks and best infer the purpose, instructions, sections, and variables from the user-input. If instructions are given, use them to guide the other xml blocks.</instruction>
    <instruction>Emphasize exact XML structure and nesting. Clearly define which blocks must contain which elements to ensure a well-formed output.</instruction>
    <instruction>Ensure that each section builds logically upon the previous ones, creating a coherent narrative from purpose to instructions, sections, and examples.</instruction>
    <instruction>Use direct, simple language and avoid unnecessary complexity to make the final prompt easy to understand.</instruction>
    <instruction>After creating the full prompt, perform a final validation to confirm that all placeholders, instructions, and examples are included, properly formatted, and consistent.</instruction>
    <instruction>If examples are not requested, don't create them.</instruction>
    <instruction>If sections are not requested, don't create them.</instruction>
    <instruction>If variables are not requested, just create a section for the user-input.</instruction>

    <example>
        <user-contract-request>
            The following is a rental agreement for an apartment. It includes information about monthly rent, security deposit, responsibilities for maintenance, and conditions for early termination.
        </user-contract-request>
        <sample-contract-text>
            The tenant agrees to pay a monthly rent of $1,500 due on the 1st of each month. The tenant will provide a security deposit of $1,500, refundable at the end of the lease term, provided there is no damage. The tenant is responsible for routine maintenance of the property, while the landlord will handle structural repairs. Early termination requires a 30-day notice and forfeiture of half the security deposit.
        </sample-contract-text>
        <summary>
            - Monthly Rent: $1,500 due on the 1st  
            - Security Deposit: $1,500, refundable if no damage  
            - Maintenance: Tenant handles routine upkeep; Landlord handles major repairs  
            - Early Termination: 30-day notice required, tenant forfeits half of the deposit
        </summary>
        <action-points>
            1. Mark your calendar to pay rent by the 1st each month.  
            2. Keep the property clean and address routine maintenance promptly.  
            3. Consider the cost of forfeiting half the deposit if ending the lease early.
        </action-points>
    </example>

    <example>
        <user-contract-request>
            The user provides a service contract for IT support. It details response times, monthly service fees, confidentiality clauses, and conditions for termination due to non-payment.
        </user-contract-request>
        <sample-contract-text>
            The service provider will respond to support requests within 24 hours. A monthly fee of $300 is payable on the 15th of each month. All proprietary information disclosed will remain confidential. The provider may suspend services if payment is not received within 7 days of the due date.

            - Non-Payment: Services suspended if not paid within 7 days after due date
        </summary>
        <action-points>
            1. Ensure timely payment by the 15th each month to avoid service suspension.  
            2. Log requests clearly so provider can respond within 24 hours.  
            3. Protect and do not disclose any proprietary information.
        </action-points>
    </example>

    <example>
        <user-contract-request>
            An employment contract is provided. It details annual salary, health benefits, employee responsibilities, and grounds for termination (e.g., misconduct or underperformance).
        </user-contract-request>
        <sample-contract-text>
            The employee will receive an annual salary of $60,000 paid in bi-weekly installments. The employer provides health insurance benefits effective from the 30th day of employment. The employee is expected to meet performance targets set quarterly. The employer may terminate the contract for repeated underperformance or serious misconduct.
        </sample-contract-text>
        <summary>
            - Compensation: $60,000/year, paid bi-weekly  
            - Benefits: Health insurance after 30 days  
            - Performance: Quarterly targets must be met  
            - Termination: Possible if underperformance is repeated or misconduct occurs
        </summary>
        <action-points>
            1. Track and meet performance goals each quarter.  
            2. Review the insurance coverage details after 30 days of employment.
