<Instructions>

Take the following markdown and parse the brain dump into a well structured list of high level objectives. Structure them in the order of most logical execution, breaking it down into more atomic development steps so as to prevent trying to make too many changes at once. Each step should only really make one functional change and be easily testable and iterated on if necessary.

Leave the Mid-Level Objective section and all below it as they are without any modifications. Your task is simply to create the breakdown. After this, we will use the breakdown to turn each step into a fully qualified markdown document in this format, describing each step in terms high, mid, and low level implementation details.

The app will be built with next.js v14, supabase and vercel. Emails are handled by integration with Resend, and the capcha code (an already implemented detail) is provided by the google cloud recaptcha v3 service.

## High-Level Objective

- [High level goal goes here - what do you want to build?]
- The new feature is a hidden competition dashboard where users who are directed to the page with a 'saigo' url ref (optional: encrypt a secret string into this number to see if anyone finds it as a little easter egg) have a conditional action on clicking the privacy policy link in the footer; this directs them to a new sign up page. This sign up page is a clone of the existing sign up page, but with a different daisy ui theme for dramatic effect. They can sign in via google auth or magic link; both protected by google recaptcha (this could earn reputation points with some of the more technically astute users, and it fits with the theme of classified knowledge - it would be possible to change the recaptcha iframe element with some custom HTML with the higher balance logo, "protected by HBI", just for added slick). On successful login they are directed to a new page where it is explained they are going to be assigned a username generated by AI to hide their real identity from other users. The aim is to encourage competition, but to take ego out of it. The leaderboard will rank descending in terms of total points, with the total score sum at the bottom allocated to "Alisone"; a symbol of unification, that it is the total group effort that is ultimately important, that when we succeed we help others to succeed, and in the end it is the team that determines the true victory. When they hit submit a call will be made to an LLM with a prompt explaining the nature of the event, and to generate a code username based on the theme. It should be no more than 3 conjoined words, in the style of futuristic hacker/mystic almost cyberpunk feeling. This LLM will have a tool that checks the username table in the database to prevent duplicates; it will continue to generate names until it gets a unique one (the odds of this are quite low if the username is of sufficient length and a mixture of lowercase, uppercase and numbers, so this might be unnecessary complexity - TBD). The new username is stored in a supabase table Username that links to the Email table. On successful allocation they are redirected to the competiton leaderboard homepage. At the top of that leaderboard is a button styled link "Use the Force, {{username}}"; on click this switches out the competition leaderboard component with a component responsible for creating a new Force entry; a form that lists out each practice they might have engaged in (e.g meditation, energy movements, the tones, the inbetween, sitting in the rain, contibuting to discord etc). Each activity will have a numeric input that selects the number of minutes attributed to that activity. On clicking Submit, the form makes a post call to a new route that is responsible for assigning these points to the Force table database. Before table update, it makes a pseudo random chance of scoring 0.2 or less (to represent a 2% chance) to each minute present. If successful, the minute is multiplied by 10x. This represents the chaotic nature of the universe, and how there is always a certain amount of asymmetrical reward to the activity we do. The pseudorandom chance modifier is itself influenced by the number of minutes; the greater the number of minutes. For each minute, there is a 2% chance that minute is multiplied by 10. This encourages people to practice more; there is a compounding return on efforts applied. After calculations are complete, the total score is submitted to the Force table that records username, date and force (as total points). After successful update, the force table component is switched back to competition leaderboard total. Each user can only submit their activity once each day, so the "Use the force, {{username}}" button link route should make a check for an entry on todays date for that user before addition. If they have already submitted, an error message is returned that updates the button state notification message that is positioned just below the button, to notify the user they have already submitted. This notification message fades away after a few seconds. Alternatively, the button could make a check on render and if the user has submitted that day, simply disable the button and change the text. This is better than removing the button entirely so as to prevent too many structural UI changes which makes for bad UX.

1. Check for url param to conditionally change the privacy policy link ref
2. Create the new sign up page
3. ...
