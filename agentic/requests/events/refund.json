  "body": "I am extremely dissatisfied with your product and demand an immediate refund. I purchased the TechGear Ultra 4K TV just two weeks ago, and it has already stopped working. The screen is completely black, and none of the buttons respond. This is unacceptable for a premium-priced item. I've already wasted hours trying to troubleshoot this issue. I want a full refund and someone to pick up this defective TV from my home ASAP. If this is not resolved quickly, I will be forced to leave negative reviews and report this to consumer protection agencies. I expect to hear back from a manager within 24 hours."
