# Introduction

The GenAI Launchpad is a production-ready boilerplate for building event-driven AI applications. It bridges the gap between proof-of-concept AI integrations and production-ready systems by providing a robust, scalable architecture that handles all the complex infrastructure pieces developers typically need to build from scratch.

## What GenAI Launchpad Is

At its core, GenAI Launchpad is an architectural framework that provides:

1. **Event-Driven Foundation**: Every interaction in your application flows through a consistent event pipeline:
   - Events enter through FastAPI endpoints
   - Get persisted in PostgreSQL
   - Process through Celery workers
   - Results store back in the database
   - Optional callbacks notify external systems

2. **AI Integration Framework**: Built-in abstractions for working with:
   - OpenAI's GPT models
   - Anthropic's Claude
   - Custom AI models
   - Vector embeddings and similarity search
   - Prompt management and versioning

3. **Production Infrastructure**: Ready-to-use components including:
   - PostgreSQL for robust data persistence
   - Redis for fast caching and task queues
   - Celery for reliable background processing
   - Caddy for SSL/TLS and reverse proxy
   - Docker for consistent deployments
   - Alembic for database migrations

4. **Development Tooling**:
   - Clear project structure
   - Local development setup
   - Testing frameworks
   - Logging configuration

## What GenAI Launchpad Is Not

- **Not an Agent Framework**: While you can build agent-like systems using our pipeline architecture, GenAI Launchpad isn't primarily an agent framework like AutoGPT or LangChain Agents. Instead, it provides the infrastructure to build any type of AI application, including but not limited to agents.

- **Not Opinionated About AI Logic**: We don't dictate how you should implement your AI logic. Our pipeline system is flexible enough to work with any approach:
  - Use our built-in pipeline system
  - Integrate LangChain
  - Implement LlamaIndex
  - Build custom solutions

- **Not a Closed System**: Every component is designed to be replaceable:
  - Swap PostgreSQL for MongoDB
  - Replace Redis with RabbitMQ
  - Use different AI providers
  - Implement custom pipeline processors

## Real-World Usage

The GenAI Launchpad excels at building:

- Content Analysis Systems
- AI-Powered Workflows
- Document Processing Pipelines
- Custom ChatGPT-like Applications
- AI Integration APIs
- Automated Content Generation
- Knowledge Base Systems


The GenAI Launchpad is more than just a template â€“ it's a complete foundation for building production-grade AI applications. Whether you're building a simple AI-powered API or a complex event-driven system, GenAI Launchpad provides the infrastructure you need to focus on your unique business logic rather than reinventing the wheel.
